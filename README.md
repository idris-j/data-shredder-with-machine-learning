Advanced Data Shredder
An advanced Python-based data shredding tool that securely shreds sensitive documents. Using machine learning, this tool can classify documents by sensitivity level and automatically shred files marked as high-risk. Ideal for organizations and individuals looking to enhance their data security practices.

Features
Secure Data Shredding: Uses advanced algorithms to overwrite and permanently delete files, ensuring they cannot be recovered.
Machine Learning Classification: Automatically classifies documents based on sensitivity, allowing for automated shredding of high-risk files.
Customizable Sensitivity Levels: Allows users to set specific criteria for what constitutes a "sensitive" document.
Batch Processing: Shred multiple files at once, with classification and shredding workflows integrated seamlessly.
Logging: Logs shredding activity for accountability and audit trails.
How It Works
Document Classification
Using a pre-trained machine learning model, the tool first classifies documents based on sensitivity. This classification can be customized using different models (e.g., NLP-based models for textual documents, image classification models for visual documents).

File Shredding
Files marked as "highly sensitive" are shredded using secure deletion methods (e.g., multiple overwrites), rendering them irretrievable.

User-Defined Rules
Users can define rules based on file type, keywords, or sensitivity thresholds to customize the shredding process.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
scikit-learn (for basic machine learning models)
pandas and numpy (for data handling)
secure-delete or shred (for secure file deletion)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/advanced-data-shredder.git
cd advanced-data-shredder
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the machine learning model:

You can use a pre-trained model for classification (e.g., BERT for text data).
Alternatively, train your own model with labeled data to classify document sensitivity levels.
Usage
Train or Load the Classifier Model

To use the default classification, you can load a pre-trained model provided in the repo, or you can train your own:

python
Copy code
python train_model.py --data path/to/dataset.csv
Run the Shredder

Start the shredder with the following command:

bash
Copy code
python shredder.py --directory /path/to/documents --sensitivity high
--directory specifies the folder containing documents to scan.
--sensitivity sets the threshold for classification (e.g., "high" for shredding highly sensitive documents only).
Customize Settings

You can customize sensitivity settings in config.yaml. This includes:

File types to scan
Sensitivity level threshold
Number of overwrite passes for shredding
Example Workflow
Document Classification
The tool will first analyze files in the specified directory, using the classifier to categorize files by sensitivity level.

Shredding
Documents classified as "highly sensitive" are passed to the shredding function, which overwrites the file multiple times before deletion.

Logging
A log file is generated to track which files were shredded, along with timestamps and sensitivity classifications.

Model Training (Optional)
If you'd like to improve the classification accuracy, you can retrain the model:

Gather Training Data
Create a labeled dataset with examples of "sensitive" and "non-sensitive" documents.

Train the Model
Use the train_model.py script to train a new model:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py --data path/to/dataset.csv
Evaluate the Model
Check accuracy and fine-tune the model to improve classification results.

Planned Features
Improved Model Tuning: Fine-tuning of sensitivity thresholds based on user feedback.
File Encryption: Option to encrypt sensitive files instead of shredding.
Cloud Integration: Integrate with cloud storage solutions for secure shredding in cloud environments.

Disclaimer
Use this tool responsibly. Make sure to verify all settings before running it, as shredded files cannot be recovered.
